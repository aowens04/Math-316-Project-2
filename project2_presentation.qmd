## Questions
* What are the key demographic and financial profiles of clients who subscribe to a term deposit compared to those who do not?
* How does the strategy of the marketing campaign itself (specifically the timing and frequency of contact) correlate with the success rate of subscriptions?
* To what extent does a client's past interaction with the bank, including previous campaign outcomes, predict their likelihood of subscribing in the current campaign?
